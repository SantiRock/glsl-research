# GLSL Research

## Description
In this project I seek to explore the GLSL shading language through the WebGL API.

## Why
As an audiovisual artist, my main interest in programming is computer graphics. In the glsl shader language I have found an incredible universe, although difficult, related to my search for efficiency, speed and fluidity in interactive and/or real time images.  

## Stack
Developed with solidjs and webgl
